## üìÅ Folder Setup

Replace the following in your script:
- `local_folder`: Set your local folder path.
- `drive_folder_id`: Find your Google Drive folder ID by opening it in a browser and copying the ID from the URL.

---

## Output

Each file from the local folder will be uploaded to the selected Drive folder, and you'll see:

```bash
Uploaded: file1.pdf
Uploaded: file2.docx
...
```

---


- The first time you run the script, it will create a `credentials.json` for you.
- This method uses **user-based OAuth**, so only authorized users can run it unless the app is verified.
